<b>get_next_line</b>

Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let
you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.<br>
Your function should return the line that was read.<br>
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.<br>


<b>get_next_line_bonus</b><br>
Manages multiple file descriptors at the same time.<br>
